# HfO₂ mode–strain channel study: bounded experiment ledger

Execution plan: `docs/VARNEB_JCTC_HFO2_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`.
Date: 2026-10-08. No physical result is inferred from a unit-test fixture.

## E001 — Stable eliminated-subspace curvature

- Hypothesis: a stable orthogonal harmonic block gives a well-defined local
  conditional curvature; unstable/unresolved blocks invalidate this reduction.
- Change: new calculator-independent `vcneb/relaxed_curvature.py`.
- Measurement: analytic quadratic minimization, retained saddle, rotation
  covariance, clamped omitted directions, invalid/marginal blocks.
- Decision: retain analytic foundation: 23 focused tests and 684 full-worktree
  tests passed (one skipped); physical application remains pending. Added
  historical-summary normalization tests are reported separately below.
- Novelty boundary: the Schur complement is established, not a new theorem.

## E002 — Same-input replica of two historical HfO₂ peaks

- Hypothesis: historical ordinary and guided peak results are reproducible under
  genuine `mpirun -np 32`, without changing INPUT/KPT/STRU/pseudopotentials/orbitals.
- Change: new isolated Slurm array, two statics only; source images read-only.
- Measurement: source/replica hashes, one DSIZE=32, SCF evidence, all 12 forces and
  six ASE stress components, energy/force/stress differences, timing, affinity.
- Expected precision: 1e-5 eV/cell, 1e-4 eV/Å force, 0.02 kbar stress. These are
  reproducibility tolerances, not new endpoint/NEB convergence requirements.
- Decision: ordinary peak passed real SCF in job `28237630_0` (node11), exact
  energy/force/stress agreement and SCF wall time 128.43 s. Job `28237630_1`
  failed at Hydra bootstrap on node26 before ABACUS began; no electronic result
  exists for that element. Preserve that failure, retry only the missing case.
  A pass does not certify either peak as a TS or identify which nonpolar mode
  changed sign.
- Launcher-only repair: within a one-node 32-CPU Slurm allocation use Intel MPI
  `I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP=fork`, then verify 32 ranks/affinity and the raw SCF
  again. The physical files stay byte-identical. This is documented by Intel:
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/mpi-library/developer-reference-linux/2021-15/hydra-environment-variables.html
- Full local worktree: 690 passed, one skipped after normalization tests.
- Missing guided point completed as `28238926_1` (node11, single-node fork):
  genuine DSIZE=32, SCF 123.37 s, exact source energy/force/stress agreement.
  Both historical peak results now pass static reproducibility. This excludes
  replica launcher/input drift as the cause of their energy difference, but
  does not identify the channel modes or establish sub-meV barrier accuracy.

## E004 — Atomic/strain local work probes

- Eight new SCFs only: atomic component of the local chain secant and scaled
  symmetric xx+yy strain, both at ±0.01 and ±0.02 Å chart steps. P_ext remains 0.
- Geometry changes are the intended variable. INPUT/KPT/pseudopotential/orbital
  hashes remain identical to the historical 100-Ry/10-au baseline.
- Preparation requires actual HF ASE-ABACUS STRU roundtrip, ordered Hf4O8,
  positive volume and minimum distance >1.6 Å before any submission.
- Measurements: finite-energy derivative versus force/stress derivative, paired
  energy curvature versus gradient curvature, and two-step dependence. These
  are local nonstationary diagnostics, not Γ phonons or full-space TS certification.
- Budget: eight points, one node ×32 MPI each, max three simultaneously, 30-min
  wall-time cap per element. No endpoint optimization or full landscape rerun.
- Decision: pending true DFT. All sources must be immutable commit archives.

## E003 — Ordered geometry comparison

- Historical final snapshots: ordinary step30 and guided step300, seven total
  images each, downloaded read-only from the source runs.
- Both ordered initial/final structural hashes match exactly; nearest-link
  final periodic unwrap integers also match. Therefore this audit does not
  show an endpoint permutation or different final lattice winding.
- Maximum translation-free atomic RMS separation at equal normalized geometric
  arc is 0.1695786428 Å. The interpolation here aligns geometries only; it does
  not create DFT points, phonon labels, a topology proof or a new TS.
- Measurement: `geometry_comparison.json` contains complete per-image cells,
  displacement/translation records and source file hashes; together with the
  endpoint fractional coordinates the ordered structures can be reconstructed.
- Decision: retain distinct channel candidates; mode identity still pending.

## Existing evidence and non-results

- ABACUS ordinary-7/9: 39.187725/39.0523 meV/f.u.; historical CI-7: 32.29305.
- Guided-7: 0.963925 meV/f.u., fmax=0.0866792767, passes 0.10 but not original 0.05;
  sub-meV barrier resolution and exact variant identity are not yet established.
- VASP 27727755/27727756: Slurm FAILED/exit1 after about 9.5 hours. Actual wrapper
  output reports `step_limit_reached`, fmax 0.2030435724/0.2784290788. This is a
  nonconvergence audit exit, **not a newly observed VASP crash/Bravais error**.
  Provisional barriers 0.01123034/0.44605894 eV/cell are not final production results.
- Source code of submitted jobs will be a clean, archived commit. Dirty user
  BTO docs/figures/scripts are excluded. Branch push does not run PyPI workflow.
